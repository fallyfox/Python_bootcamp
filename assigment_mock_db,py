#Use a dictionary to create a database
#The database uses username to conatin each person's information
#each person has the following info: First name, surname, department, age
#write an input statement that can allow each person to change his department
#Security: a person can only change his department if only his username exists in the database, and if the surname you ask him for matches what is in the database
